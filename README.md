This is simple blog project i made, with the idea to expand on it with a login/credentials update, adding a database and CRUD functionalities later on.
For now it has a simple starting page where the input from the form is rendered as a headeer element and paragraph.
The styling is done mostly with bootstrap, but thats subject to change later on.
